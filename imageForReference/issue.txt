This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Request**: User shared a roadmap showing improvement priorities for an event management platform. The first priority was "Analytics CSV/PDF Export" which was completed in a previous session.

2. **Previous Session Summary**: From the context, I can see that in the previous session:
   - Analytics CSV/PDF Export was completed
   - Session Auth in API was completed
   - Auth Security Fix was started and continued in this session

3. **This Session's Focus**: The user asked to "continue what you left off" - which was the Auth Security Fix implementation.

4. **Auth Security Fix Implementation** - I completed all 8 phases:
   - Phase 1: Updated sessions schema with accessToken, refreshToken, new indexes
   - Phase 1: Created password validation utility (12+ chars, complexity)
   - Phase 1: Updated customAuth.ts with refresh tokens, token rotation
   - Phase 2: Added HTTP cookie auth endpoints (/api/auth/login, /signup, /logout, /refresh, /me)
   - Phase 3: Updated lib/auth.ts to use new access token structure
   - Phase 4: Refactored frontend AuthContext for cookie-based auth with auto-refresh
   - Phase 4: Added password strength UI to SignUp page
   - Phase 5: Created migration script for existing sessions

5. **Key Files Modified**:
   - convex/schema.ts - sessions table updated
   - convex/lib/passwordValidation.ts - NEW
   - convex/customAuth.ts - major updates
   - convex/http.ts - added auth endpoints
   - convex/lib/auth.ts - updated indexes
   - convex/organizerProfiles.ts - updated to use accessToken
   - src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx - full refactor
   - src/pages/auth/SignUp.tsx - password strength UI
   - src/components/auth/AuthRedirect.tsx - use accessToken
   - src/components/app/OrganizationSwitcher.tsx - use accessToken
   - src/pages/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx - use accessToken
   - src/pages/dashboard/SettingsPage.tsx - use accessToken
   - src/pages/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx - use accessToken
   - src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx - updated mocks
   - convex/migrations/migrateSessionsToNewSchema.ts - NEW

6. **E2E Tests**: User asked to run E2E tests. Result: 8 passed, 10 skipped (those requiring auth).

7. **Current State**: User's last message was "dont deploy yet. help me find what to improve first" - asking to review the roadmap for next improvements.

8. **Roadmap Status**:
   - ✅ Analytics CSV/PDF Export (completed)
   - ✅ Session Auth in API (completed)
   - ✅ Auth Security Fix (just completed)
   - 📝 Notifications System (4-5 days) - NEXT
   - 📝 Multi-Tenancy/Organizations (5-7 days)
   - 📝 Error Handling & Monitoring (2 days)
   - 📝 API Documentation (3-4 days)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user is working through a prioritized roadmap of improvements for an event management platform. In this session, the user asked to "continue what you left off" which was completing the Auth Security Fix implementation. After completing all phases, the user asked to run E2E tests to verify the implementation, then asked "dont deploy yet. help me find what to improve first" to identify the next improvement from the roadmap.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - httpOnly cookies for XSS protection
   - Refresh token rotation (access: 15min, refresh: 7 days)
   - Password validation (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
   - Convex database with sessions table
   - HTTP endpoints with Set-Cookie headers
   - Cookie-based auth with `credentials: 'include'`
   - Access token in memory for Convex WebSocket queries (not localStorage)
   - Auto-refresh tokens every 14 minutes
   - Migration scripts for schema changes

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **convex/schema.ts** - Updated sessions table:
     ```typescript
     sessions: defineTable({
       userId: v.id('users'),
       accessToken: v.string(),
       refreshToken: v.string(),
       accessTokenExpiresAt: v.number(),
       refreshTokenExpiresAt: v.number(),
       createdAt: v.number(),
       userAgent: v.optional(v.string()),
       ipAddress: v.optional(v.string()),
     })
       .index('by_access_token', ['accessToken'])
       .index('by_refresh_token', ['refreshToken'])
       .index('by_user', ['userId']),
     ```

   - **convex/lib/passwordValidation.ts** - NEW file for password validation:
     ```typescript
     export const PASSWORD_REQUIREMENTS = {
       minLength: 12,
       requireUppercase: true,
       requireLowercase: true,
       requireNumber: true,
       requireSpecial: true,
     }
     
     export function validatePassword(password: string): PasswordValidation {
       // Validates against all requirements, returns { isValid, errors, strength }
     }
     ```

   - **convex/customAuth.ts** - Major updates including:
     - Token expiry constants (15min access, 7 day refresh)
     - Updated createUserWithSession and createSessionForUser for new schema
     - Added refreshSessionInternal for token rotation
     - Added signInInternal for HTTP endpoints
     - Added getUserByAccessToken internal query
     - All queries/mutations use `by_access_token` index

   - **convex/http.ts** - Added auth endpoints:
     ```typescript
     // POST /api/auth/login - with httpOnly cookies
     // POST /api/auth/signup - with httpOnly cookies
     // POST /api/auth/logout - clears cookies
     // POST /api/auth/refresh - rotates tokens
     // GET /api/auth/me - returns user from cookie
     ```

   - **src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx** - Full refactor for cookie-based auth:
     ```typescript
     interface AuthContextType {
       user: User | null
       accessToken: string | null  // For Convex queries (in memory only)
       isLoading: boolean
       isAuthenticated: boolean
       signIn, signUp, signOut, refreshAuth
     }
     // Uses fetch with credentials: 'include'
     // Auto-refreshes every 14 minutes
     ```

   - **src/pages/auth/SignUp.tsx** - Added password strength indicator with visual feedback

   - **convex/migrations/migrateSessionsToNewSchema.ts** - NEW migration script

   - Updated components to use `accessToken` instead of `sessionToken`:
     - OrganizationSwitcher, AuthRedirect, DashboardOverview, SettingsPage, Onboarding, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx

4. Errors and fixes:
   - Unit tests failed with "Vitest failed to find the runner" - This was a pre-existing configuration issue, not caused by auth changes
   - No errors in the auth implementation itself - TypeScript passed after each phase

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved the challenge of Convex WebSocket not having cookie access by returning accessToken in HTTP response body (stored in memory, not localStorage)
   - Implemented hybrid approach: httpOnly cookies for security + in-memory token for Convex queries
   - Created comprehensive migration script for existing sessions

6. All user messages:
   - "continue what you left off" (to continue Auth Security Fix)
   - "should we run E2E test? if so then proceed"
   - "dont deploy yet. help me find what to improve first"

7. Pending Tasks:
   From the roadmap, remaining improvements:
   - Notifications System (4-5 days) - P0
   - Multi-Tenancy/Organizations (5-7 days) - P0
   - Error Handling & Monitoring (2 days) - P1
   - API Documentation (3-4 days) - P1

8. Current Work:
   The Auth Security Fix is complete. E2E tests passed (8 passed, 10 skipped). User's last message was "dont deploy yet. help me find what to improve first" - I read the roadmap file (issue.txt) to show remaining improvements.

9. Optional Next Step:
   User asked "help me find what to improve first" - I should present the remaining improvements from the roadmap for the user to choose:
   - **Notifications System** (4-5 days, P0) - In-app notifications, email via Resend, real-time updates
   - **Multi-Tenancy/Organizations** (5-7 days, P0) - Team collaboration, org roles, invitations
   - **Error Handling & Monitoring** (2 days, P1) - Sentry integration, error boundaries
   - **API Documentation** (3-4 days, P1) - OpenAPI/Swagger, interactive explorer

   The user needs to choose which improvement to tackle next..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
