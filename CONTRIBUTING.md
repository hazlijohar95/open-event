## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Branch Naming Convention

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/description` | `feature/add-calendar-view` |
| Bug fix | `fix/description` | `fix/event-date-picker` |
| Docs | `docs/description` | `docs/update-readme` |
| Refactor | `refactor/description` | `refactor/auth-flow` |

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the coding standards below

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:run

# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run build
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

See [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines) below.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` and type guards
- Define types in `src/types/` for reusable types
- Use strict mode (already configured)

```typescript
// Good
function processEvent(event: Event): ProcessedEvent {
  return { ...event, processed: true }
}

// Avoid
function processEvent(event: any): any {
  return { ...event, processed: true }
}
```

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the patterns in `CLAUDE.md`
- Avoid unnecessary `useEffect` - calculate during render when possible
- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations

```tsx
// Good - calculate during render
const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

// Avoid - unnecessary effect
const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('')
useEffect(() => {
  setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName)
}, [firstName, lastName])
```

### Styling

- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Use the `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- Follow the design system in `CLAUDE.md`
- Use Phosphor Icons with `duotone` weight

```tsx
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
import { Calendar } from '@phosphor-icons/react'

<div className={cn(
  'p-4 rounded-lg',
  isActive && 'bg-primary'
)}>
  <Calendar size={24} weight="duotone" />
</div>
```

### Convex

- Use typed validators from `convex/values`
- Always define argument schemas
- Use indexes for filtered queries
- Handle authorization in every mutation/query

```typescript
export const create = mutation({
  args: {
    title: v.string(),
    date: v.number(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const user = await getCurrentUser(ctx)
    if (!user) throw new Error('Authentication required')

    return await ctx.db.insert('events', {
      ...args,
      organizerId: user._id,
    })
  },
})
```
