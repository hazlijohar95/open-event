# Key Format is Correct! ✅

## Test Results

Your test mutation shows:
- ✅ `success: true` - Key can be imported successfully
- ✅ `importError: null` - No import errors
- ✅ Key format is valid (single-line PKCS#8 is acceptable)

## The Issue

The key format is **correct**, but you may still be seeing the error due to:
1. **Cached/stale Convex server state** - The server needs a full restart
2. **Error happening at a different time** - The error might be from before the key was fixed

## Solution

### Step 1: Full Server Restart

1. **Stop** your Convex dev server completely (Ctrl+C)
2. **Wait 10 seconds** (to ensure all processes are stopped)
3. **Restart**: `npx convex dev`
4. **Wait** for "Convex functions ready!" message

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (Optional)

1. Open your browser in **Incognito/Private mode**
2. Or clear browser cache and cookies for `localhost:5173`

### Step 3: Test Sign-In

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/sign-in`
2. Try signing in with your credentials
3. The error should be gone now

## If Error Persists

If you still see the PKCS#8 error after a full restart:

1. **Check the exact error message** - When does it occur?
   - During sign-in?
   - During sign-up?
   - At page load?

2. **Check Convex Dashboard logs** - Look for the exact timestamp and error

3. **Run the test mutation again** - Verify the key is still valid:
   - Go to Convex Dashboard → Functions
   - Run `testKeyFormat:testKeyFormat`
   - Should still show `success: true`

## Key Format Note

Your key is on a single line, which is **perfectly valid** for PKCS#8 format. The `jose` library accepts both:
- Multi-line format (with line breaks)
- Single-line format (all on one line)

Both are valid PKCS#8 formats, so your key is correct! ✅
