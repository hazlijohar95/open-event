Here is the project folder

open-event\

Create a FORME.md that explains:

- What this project does
- How the project is organized
- What each folder is responsible for

Keep the FORME short, practical, and focused on understanding the codebase.

#Update the existing FORME.md to reflect recent changes in the project structure.

Rules:

- Preserve all content that is still correct
- Modify only outdated sections
- Do not introduce new sections unless necessary
- Keep changes minimal and precise

After updating, briefly list what changed in the FORME.
